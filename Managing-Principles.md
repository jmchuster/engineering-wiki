### Structure

- Everyone should have one and only one manager that they report to.
- A manager is different from a **mentor** and ideally a different person.

### Purpose

- The job of the manager is to help their reports become who they want to be and experience what they want to experience.
- The job of the manager is to make everyone better at their jobs.

### One-on-ones

- A manager is responsible for holding weekly one-on-ones with each of their reports.
- The purpose of the one-on-one is to  

    - Get feedback on how the company is doing, tracking the trend of the health of the team.
    - Help the report improve via straightforward, fact-based feedback.

- The meeting is not a progress check on projects.
- The report should be setting the agenda of the one-on-one.

### Characteristics

- A manager needs to exhibit good judgement.
- A manager needs to keep a running tab of what is broken in the organization and needs fixing, in addition to their own wants and desires for the company.
- A manager is constantly watched by his or her reports and must be aware of the subconscious influence they wield just by their behavior and the things they talk about.
