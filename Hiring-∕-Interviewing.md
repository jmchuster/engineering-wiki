### Goals

Pluses

- looking to be a strong contributor
- looking to be a lead developer
- looking to contribute to design and architecture

Minuses

- looking to be a "manager" or an "architect" that is hands-off from the code

### Degrees

Pluses

- Undergrad CS degrees, especially from hard Engineering schools
- Hard classes like Data Structures & Algorithms, Operating Systems

Minuses

- Masters degrees are essentially meaningless
- Be wary when Bootcamps are the only experience

### Languages

Pluses

- one primary language they're skilled in
- multiple languages that they've worked with
- a self-taught language
- experience with both compiled and scripting languages
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- quick and eager to learn new languages
- good approach to learning new languages

Minuses

- listing languages on the resume that they can't code in if needed
- over-dependence on tools and libraries instead of the core language
- heavy magic frameworks that generate code like GWT and ASP.Net
- Compile-to-JS (e.g. CoffeeScript) experience without understanding JavaScript

### Experience

Pluses

- web application experience, especially full-stack (database, server, client)
- class projects where they were the primary coder
- contributing to open-source projects
- projects built from scratch instead of modifying an existing system
- architecting and then implementing a flow that spans multiple servers
- understanding the business context of a project

Minuses

- class projects where they "managed the team" or just "designed the UI"
- projects that have too many people to know who really did what
- lack of involvement/intention/interest in testing or ops
- heavily segmented or isolated work
- lack of understanding of overall architecture and how your piece fits in
- inability to explain your project in deep technical detail

### Coding

Pluses

- crank out the code easily
- comfortable with loops and indices, nested loops
- reach for lists and maps as basic data structures
- be able to explain the basic pseudo code solution before implementing it
- be able to explain and walk through the code
- be able to reason about the code
- be able to quickly identify bugs
- be able to recognize and understand alternative ways of writing the code
- noting libraries and known helper functions that could be used

Minuses

- messy indentation
- misunderstanding of control flow
- taking a long time to identify a bug, especially when missed during a walk through
- aimlessly coding without an end goal in mind
- blindly trying code to see if it might work
- unable to code without the use of helper functions
- requiring the internet for programming basics
