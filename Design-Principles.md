### Build Heuristics

- Will users have a clear next step?
- Will the average user love this feature?  Will this delight our users?
- Will this distract or confuse the average user?  Does this follow the principle of least astonishment?
- Are you starting from the feature or are you starting from the use case?
- Did you talk to actual users about what they want?

### New Designs

- To fully evaluate a potential new design requires you to **see** it, **use** it, and **feel** it.
- Every step in the design process allows us to get more and more feedback, at the cost of more and more work to change the design.  Distribute your design process appropriately along this scale.
    - *Talking to users and finding their pain points* - This informs the motivation behind the new feature you want to build.
    - *Drawing a design on a whiteboard and reviewing it with team members* - The sky's the limit on what you think will best solve your users' wants and needs,
    - *Building mockup images and reviewing it with users* - There might be a couple of major design directions for users to choose from.
    - *Building a working prototype and reviewing it with users* - The basic direction has been decided, and it's time to hammer out the usability.
    - *Pushing out a release and reviewing it with users* - Refine edge cases for data you didn't anticipate.  After letting it sink in for a few weeks, ask your users and see if you actually solved the original problem.
- Test your design with the first 5 people that walk by your cubicle.  [http://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/)
