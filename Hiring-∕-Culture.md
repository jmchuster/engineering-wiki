### We should hire engineers who will

- have strong ownership of their code all the way from development through production
- take pride in the quality of the product they have produced and the code they have written
- engage in fruitful design discussions to help others and improve themselves
- look to grow and improve their skills
- get shit done

### These engineers should already

- have strong fundamentals of coding, portable to any language
- write code that is self-evident to others and their future self
- be able to read and understand code and its intent, refactoring it to better fit the requirements at hand

### We do not want engineers who

- write code and throw it over a wall
- blindly copy-paste code
- follow conventions without understanding why and when they should work
- are continuously drawn to the new hotness
- look to assign blame when there are bugs
- hesitate to touch code for fear of breaking things
